# Sketchy - doodle to your delight!

Sketchy is an app where you can make drawings with different colors and brush sizes and save them to your collections. You may mark pictures as public so they can be seen by other users, or you may mark the drawings as a "favorite" for yourself.

This project was a group project made with @HenPVel at Flatiron School for Phase 4.
